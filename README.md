# Kafka Spring Boot Project

This project is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates the usage of advanced features of Apache Kafka. It provides examples for publishing and consuming messages from a Kafka topic, implementing retry and recovery mechanisms, integration testing with embedded Kafka, and error handling.

## Features

1. **Publishing and Consuming from a Topic**: The project includes examples of producing messages to a Kafka topic and consuming messages from the same topic using Apache Kafka's Java client library.

2. **Retry and Recovery**: It demonstrates how to implement retry and recovery mechanisms when encountering failures during message processing. This helps ensure message delivery in case of temporary issues or errors.

3. **Integration Testing with Embedded Kafka**: The project showcases how to write integration tests for Kafka-based functionality using an embedded Kafka server. This allows for robust testing without the need for an external Kafka cluster.

4. **Error Handling**: The project covers techniques for handling errors and exceptions that may occur during message processing. It demonstrates how to handle and manage different types of errors, ensuring proper handling and graceful recovery.
